# create_firebrick_directory_from_macOS_contacts
Creates a text file of name/phone number pairings from macOS's Contacts application, for inclusion in the FireBrick's VoIP directory

This is a slightly tweaked version of [this script](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8384450).

I haven't put a licence on it since I don't know the licence of the original.

Bear in mind that there is a limit on the file size of the config which the FireBrick can handle. I have added 300 contacts without a problem, but bearing this mind.
